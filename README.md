🚀 Nova Bot — The AI that Downloads and Thinks
Nova Bot is the first fully integrated smart Telegram bot that combines automatic video downloading from the internet with intelligent analysis using AI (Google Gemini), all seamlessly, quickly, and without complexity.
It was designed specifically for content enthusiasts, students, teachers, and entrepreneurs to simplify access to videos from any website—such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X (Twitter), Reddit, and other platforms. It then automatically analyzes the content to provide a smart summary in Arabic.
